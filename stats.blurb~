Mortality data were analysed and presented in figures based on actual
EF concentrations rather than target concentrations. The effect of EF
on the mortality of target pests was analysed using a robust version
of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) capabilities (Hastie et al 1992)
in R version 3.2.2 (R Core Development Team 2015). Variance was
assumed proportional to that for a binomial distribution. The analysis
assumed that the form of dependence of mortality on concentration was
that given by a complementary-log-log model, with concentration as the
explanatory variable.

The assumed form of response was log(-log(1 - p)) = a + bc,
where p = expected mortality, and c = concentration of EF. 

From the derived coefficients, the LC99 (calculated lethal
concentration) or the concentration required to produce a mortality of
99%, was calculated with adjustment for sources of mortality other
than EF. Two possible sources of extraneous mortality were considered:
handling and treatment with CO2. The mortality attributed to those
sources was compared using a simpler binomial GLM which found one to
be significantly higher than the other on occasions and the opposite
to be the case on other occasions.  To be on the conservative side,
whichever was greater was used as the control mortality, cm, in the
calculation of the LC99 values, cm + (1 - cm) x 0.99. The geometric
means of the varying number of replicates for each pest, life stage,
fruit (if with fruit) and temperature combination were calculated
along with a 95% confidence interval.

LCT99 is simply the LC99 multiplied by the number of hours of exposure
to ethyl formate.
