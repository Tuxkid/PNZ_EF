Why we need files on the disk/s in Asset MTA-D-424089.

Much of the information is available elsewhere, but a few gigabytes
pertaining to 5 years of datamining work are not stored anywhere else.
A fair proportion of the input data and of output graphs could be
available, but the code linking them is not.

It would be desirable to restore all of the /home/hrapgc/ directory
which contains a number of configuration files.  If that's not
possible, the most important is the /home/hrapgc/Rstuff/ directory
(and its subdirectories).

Other subdirectories of /home/ are not necessary.
